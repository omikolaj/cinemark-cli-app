# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
    After installing the GEM, running "new_movies" will display a CLI allowing users to interact with my GEM.
- [x ] Pull data from an external source
    "new_movies_cinemark" GEM scrapes external source https://cinemark.com/movies/coming-soon to display a list of all of the upcoming movies.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views
    Selecting a movie from the list will display details about that movie. The GEM navigates to the selected movie's website and scrapes all of the available details for that movie.
